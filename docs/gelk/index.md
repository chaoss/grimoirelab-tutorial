# GrimoireELK (Gelk)

GrimoireELK is the component of GrimoireLab that interacts with the
underlying (OpenSearch) database. Its goal is two-fold, first it aims
at offering a convenient way to store the data coming from Perceval,
second it processes and enriches the data in a format that can be
used by the Dashboards.
