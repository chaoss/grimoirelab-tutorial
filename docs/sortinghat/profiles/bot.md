# Set profile as Bot

As we know, some identities can turn out to be bots. In order to remedy that,
SortingHat provides the ability to mark profiles as Bot. It can be done either
when creating a profile or after creating a profile.

- When creating a profile, you'll have the option to mark a profile as Bot.
  Simply check that option and Save.

- After creating a profile, hover right next to the profile's name and a bunch
  of icons will appear. Click on the bot icon to mark it as bot.
