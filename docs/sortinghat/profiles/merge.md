# How to merge profiles

SortingHat provides the ability to merge profiles in the case that the said
profiles belong to the same individual. In some cases the profiles are different
identities of the same individual. As such, you have three ways of merging
profiles using SortingHat's interface.

- **Drag and Drop** 

  This method is favorable when you have just one profile to be merge. You
  simply drag that profile into the one profile you want to merge it with. Once
  you start dragging, a tooltip with **"Moving 1 individual"** will appear
  confirming that you are moving the profile wanted. Finally, bring it onto the
  profile to be merged with and release it. A dialogue will open where you'll
  have to confirm the process. To complete it, just press "Confirm". To check
  whether the profiles have been merged, click on the arrow-down icon which will
  expand the information tab.

- **Highlight profiles to be merged**

  This method is useful when you have **more than one profile to merge but they
  are all within sight**.

  1. Click on the profiles to be merged. This will highlight them. You can
     confirm that by checking whether a dark blue strip was added to leftmost
     side of the profile tab.

  2. Once selected, you'll see that the merge button will be active. Click on it
     and a confirm dialogue will open. Press confirm to complete the merge
     process.

- **Add to workspace**

  This method is suited for merging profiles that are **scattered in different
  pages.** That is the profiles are not found in the same page. In this case,
  each profile can first be added to the Workspace and merged later on.

  1. Look for the needed profiles (_Tip: filter through the profiles using the
     filter options available_)

  2. Once found, click on the "More options" icon and select **Save in
     workspace**. You'll see that a profile card is added in the Workspace
     section.

  3. Once all the profiles have been gathered, click on each card to highlight
     them and press on "Merge" on the righmost corner of the Workspace.
