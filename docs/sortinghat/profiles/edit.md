# How to edit profiles

Once a profile is created, it is possible to edit some of its information.
However some information is set during the profile creation phase and cannot be
edited.

A profile consists of two parts, **Identities** and **Organisations** data.

- **Profile** information such as Name, Email, Gender and Country are editable.
  However **Source is not editable**.
- **Identities** are **NOT editable** unless they are split up. Once split up,
  each identity is a standalone profile so the above described field would be
  editable.
- **Organisation** data such as **Date from** and **Date to** are editable.
  Organisation data can also be removed as a whole.

Tip: _If you hover on any field in profile and the edit icon appears, that means
the filed is editable._
