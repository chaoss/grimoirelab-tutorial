# Developer Installation

SirMordred is the tool used to coordinate the execution of the GrimoireLab
platform, via two main configuration files, the [setup.cfg](./setup-cfg.md) and
[projects.json](./projects-json.md), which are summarized in their corresponding
sections.

SirModred relies on Elasticsearch, Kibiter and MySQL/MariaDB. The current
versions used are:

- Elasticsearch 6.8.6
- Kibiter 6.8.6
- MySQL/MariaDB (5.7.24/10.0)

There are mainly 2 options to get started with SirMordred:
- [Source code and docker](#source-code-and-docker): In this method, the
applications (Elasticsearch, Kibiter and MariaDB) are installed using docker and
the GrimoireLab Components are installed using the source code.
- [Only docker](#only-docker): In this method, the applications (Elasticsearch,
Kibiter and MariaDB) and the GrimoireLab Components are installed using docker.

## Source code and docker

### Getting the containers

You will have to install Elasticsearch (6.8.6), Kibiter (6.8.6) and a
MySQL/MariaDB database (5.7.24/10.0). You can use the following docker-compose
to have them running.

> Help: You need to install docker and docker-compose for this. Please refer the
> documentation.
- [https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/)
- [https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

> Note: 
> 1. You can omit (comment/remove) the `mariadb` section in case you have
>    MariaDB or MySQL already installed in your system.
> 2. It is not mandatory to use docker to install Elasticsearch, Kibiter and
>    MySQL/MariaDB database. They can be installed by other means too (source
>    code). We are not much concerned about the method they are installed.
>    Docker is the easiest way as it mostly avoids the errors caused by them.

There are two versions of Elasticsearch and Kibiter which can be used, with
SearchGuard (secured one) and the without SearchGuard (not secured). You can
choose either of the versions.

**docker-compose (with SearchGuard)**

For accessing Elasticsearch/Kibiter, login credentials (`admin:admin`) is
required. You are also expected to update the configurations in the `setup.cfg`
file. See [#defining-the-es-configurations](#defining-the-es-configurations).


```yml
elasticsearch:
  image: bitergia/elasticsearch:6.8.6-secured
  command: elasticsearch -Enetwork.bind_host=0.0.0.0 -Ehttp.max_content_length=2000mb
  ports:
    - 9200:9200
  environment:
    - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g

kibiter:
  restart: on-failure:5
  image: bitergia/kibiter:secured-v6.8.6-3
  environment:
    - PROJECT_NAME=Demo
    - NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1000
    - ELASTICSEARCH_USER=kibanaserver
    - ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD=kibanaserver
    - ELASTICSEARCH_URL=["https://elasticsearch:9200"]
    - LOGIN_SUBTITLE=If you have forgotten your username or password ...
  links:
    - elasticsearch
  ports:
    - 5601:5601

mariadb:
  image: mariadb:10.0
  expose:
    - "3306"
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
    - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
```

**docker-compose (without SearchGuard)**

For accessing Elasticsearch/Kibiter, no login credentials is required. The
configurations in the `setup.cfg` file need to be updated. See
[#defining-the-es-configurations](#defining-the-es-configurations).


```yml
elasticsearch:
  image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:6.8.6
  command: elasticsearch -Enetwork.bind_host=0.0.0.0 -Ehttp.max_content_length=2000mb
  ports:
    - 9200:9200
  environment:
    - ES_JAVA_OPTS=-Xms2g -Xmx2g
    - ANONYMOUS_USER=true

kibiter:
  restart: on-failure:5
  image: bitergia/kibiter:community-v6.8.6-3
  environment:
    - PROJECT_NAME=Demo
    - NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1000
    - ELASTICSEARCH_URL=http://elasticsearch:9200
  links:
    - elasticsearch
  ports:
    - 5601:5601

mariadb:
  image: mariadb:10.0
  expose:
    - "3306"
  environment:
    - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=
    - MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD=yes
```

Save the above into a docker-compose.yml file and run
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
to get Elasticsearch, Kibiter and MariaDB running on your system.

### Cloning the repositories

In the next step, you will need to fork all the GitHub repos below and clone
them to a target local folder (e.g., `sources`).

- [SirModred](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred)
- [ELK](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-elk)
- [Graal](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal)
- [Perceval](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval)
- [Perceval for Mozilla](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-mozilla)
- [Perceval for OPNFV](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-opnfv)
- [Perceval for Puppet](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-puppet)
- [Perceval for Weblate](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval-weblate)
- [SortingHat](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sortinghat)
- [Sigils](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sigils)
- [Kidash](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-kidash)
- [Toolkit](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit)
- [Cereslib](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-cereslib)
- [Manuscripts](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-manuscripts)

Each local repo should have two `remotes`: `origin` points to the forked repo,
while `upstream` points to the original CHAOSS repo.

An example is provided below.
```bash
git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/valeriocos/perceval (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/valeriocos/perceval (push)
upstream	https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval (push)
```

In order to add a remote to a Git repository, you can use the following command:
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval
```

#### ProTip

You can use this use this
[script](https://gist.github.com/vchrombie/4403193198cd79e7ee0079259311f6e8) to
automate this whole process.
```bash
python3 glab-dev-env-setup.py --create --token xxxx --source sources
```

### Setting up PyCharm

> Help: You need to install PyCharm (**Community Edition**) for this. Please
> refer the [JetBrain's PyCharm
> documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html).
> You can follow this [PyCharm
> Quickstart](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html) to
> get familiar with PyCharm.

Once PyCharm is installed create a project in the grimoirelab-sirmordred
directory. 

PyCharm will automatically create a virtual env, where you should install the
dependencies listed in each requirements.txt, **excluding** the ones concerning
the grimoirelab components.
```
PyJWT>=1.7.1 (install)
cryptography>=3.3.1 (install)
-e git+https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-toolkit/#egg=grimoirelab-toolkit (don't install)
```

To install the dependencies, you can click on `File` -> `Settings` -> `Project`
-> `Project Interpreter`, and then the `+` located on the top right corner (see
figure below).

![project-interpreter-configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25265451/78168870-3e612580-746e-11ea-9df1-7ba94b84d07b.gif)

Later, you can add the dependencies to the grimoirelab components via `File` ->
`Settings` -> `Project` -> `Project Structure`. The final results should be
something similar to the image below.

![project-structure-configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25265451/78168879-41f4ac80-746e-11ea-9e40-dbdb1b5d32f2.gif)

### Execution

Now that you have the Elasticsearch, Kibiter and MariaDB running on your system
and the project configured in the PyCharm, we can execute
micro-mordred/sirmordred.

To execute micro-mordred, define a
[setup.cfg](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/sirmordred/utils/setup.cfg)
and
[projects.json](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-sirmordred/blob/master/sirmordred/utils/projects.json).

#### Defining the ES configurations

- For accessing Elasticsearch/Kibiter, login credentials (`admin:admin`) is
  required. You are also expected to update the configurations in the
  `setup.cfg` file.

```cfg
[es_collection]
url = https://admin:admin@localhost:9200

[es_enrichment]
url = https://admin:admin@localhost:9200
```

- For accessing Elasticsearch/Kibiter, no login credentials is required. The
  configurations in the `setup.cfg` file can be updated as below.

```cfg
[es_collection]
url = http://localhost:9200

[es_enrichment]
url = http://localhost:9200
```

### Micro Mordred

Run the following commands, which will collect and enrich the data coming from
the git sections and upload the corresponding panels to Kibiter:

```bash
micro.py --raw --enrich --cfg ./setup.cfg --backends git cocom
micro.py --panels --cfg ./setup.cfg
```

Optionally, you can create a configuration in PyCharm to speed up the executions
(`Run` -> `Edit configuration` -> `+`).

![add-micro-configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25265451/78168875-402ae900-746e-11ea-8bd8-4b3e68992bdf.gif)

The final results should be something similar to the image below.
