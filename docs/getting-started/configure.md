# Configure GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab can be setup through the use of two main configuration files,
`projects.json` and `setup.cfg`. The role and usage of each one of those files
are described in their corresponding sections.

- [projects.json]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link
  docs/getting-started/projects-json.md %})
- [setup.cfg]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/getting-started/setup-cfg.md %})
