# Configure GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab can be setup through the use of two main configuration files,
`projects.json` and `setup.cfg`. The role and usage of each one of those files
are described in their corresponding sections.

- [projects.json](docs/getting-started/projects-json/)
- [setup.cfg](docs/getting-started/setup-cfg/)
