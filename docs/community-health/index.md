# Understanding Community health

GrimoireLab is the platform through which community health can be monitored but
what is community health and how can we define it ?

Community health is the potential that a project can continue developing quality
software. There are different ways that it can be evaluated. For example, we can
analyze the health of a community through the code quality, the activity in the
community ( are the contributors active, are the issues being resolved, the
diversity of contributors) and the resources needed by the project.

Check out the following focus areas depending on your required metric.
