# Graal: a Generic Reporitory AnALyzer

Graal leverages on the Git backend of Perceval and enhances it to set
up ad-hoc source code analysis. Thus, it fetches the commits from a
Git repository and provides a mechanism to plug third party
tools/libraries focused on source code analysis.


GrimoireELK is the component of GrimoireLab that interacts with the
underlying (OpenSearch) database. Its goal is two-fold, first it aims
at offering a convenient way to store the data coming from Perceval,
second it processes and enriches the data in a format that can be
used by the Dashboards.
