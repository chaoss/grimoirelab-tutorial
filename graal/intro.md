# Graal

- [Graal](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal) [ Generic Repository AnALyzer ] with the help of Perceval's [Git backend](https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-perceval/blob/master/perceval/backends/core/git.py) fetches commits from a Git repository and provides a mechanism to plug third party tools/libraries focused on source code analysis. As of now, Graal produces analysis related to code complexity, quality, dependencies, vulnerability and licensing. In this chapter, you will learn the basics of working with Graal, including how to retrieve source code related analysis with the help of some of it's backends.

- Before starting, ensure that you have Python3 ready, and the Graal module installed, as detailed in
[Installing GrimoireLab Python modules](../basics/install.md).

**Note:** As of now, Graal is not integrated in Grimoirelab toolchain, it will soon be added to support source code related metrics.
